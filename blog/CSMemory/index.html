        <div class="section">
            <p>I recently completed my graduate degree in Computer Science from Chulalongkorn University (just waiting for the official status). Now, I want to document the memories and lessons learned throughout this 2.5-year journey</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Things I Learned Along the Way</h2>
            
            <h3>1. I learned to reframe my thoughts and choose healthier mindsets in any situation</h3>
            
            <p>If you've pursued a graduate degree, you'll likely relate to this experience: the days you feel lost and doubt your abilities. You're on a path where your advisor constantly challenges you to produce your best work and pushes you to unlock your full potential. No matter how hard you try, you'll be asked to improve iteratively. If you tie your self-worth to your thesis and rely on your advisor's validation to feel valuable, you'll never feel good enough.</p>

            <p>No matter how difficult your current situation, one thing no one can take from you is your mindset and attitude. Choose perspectives that support your mental health. As Viktor Frankl said: </p>
            
            <blockquote>
                "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances."
                <br>— Viktor Frankl
            </blockquote>
            
            <h3>2. Understand your advisor's role</h3>
            <p>Advisors don't doubt you; they challenge you to ensure you truly understand your work and can see the thesis problem from all angles. Don't take their criticism personally.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Separate your personal worth from your work</h3>
            <p>You have value as a human being independent of your academic work. Always remind yourself: "Live your life to improve, not to prove."</p>

            </div>
            
            <h3>4. Don't fear judgment—you'll be judged regardless</h3>
            <p>Accept that evaluation is inevitable and move forward anyway. Sometimes it's worth pausing to reflect on the criticism you receive—it might reveal blind spots or perspectives on improving your work that you hadn't considered before.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Just take action</h3>
            <p>Small actions reveal the next step. Even when you're at your darkest point, taking action creates a spark of light.</p>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Document your journey</strong> - Track how long you spend on problems and ask for help when needed</li>
                <li><strong>Believe in your own work</strong> - If only one person trusts your work, it should be you</li>
                <li><strong>Learn when to be open to feedback</strong> and when to protect your work</li>
                <li><strong>View obstacles as checkpoints</strong> - Every barrier signals something that needs attention</li>
                <li><strong>Rejection teaches more than acceptance</strong> - It's valuable experience for your future journey</li>
                <li><strong>Enjoy the present</strong> - Don't focus so much on the finish line that you forget the journey</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Don't blame yourself for mistakes. Zoom out from the situation and consider that maybe this incident needed to happen to equip you for future challenges. I'm grateful for everything that occurred during these 2.5 years.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Thank you, graduate school.</strong></p>
