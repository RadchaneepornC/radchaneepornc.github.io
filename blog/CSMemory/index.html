            <h2>Things I Learned Along the Way</h2>
            
            <h3>1. I learned to reframe my thoughts and choose healthier mindsets in any situation</h3>
            
            <p>If you've pursued a graduate degree, you'll likely relate to this experience: the days you feel lost and doubt your abilities. You're on a path where your advisor constantly challenges you to produce your best work and pushes you to unlock your full potential. No matter how hard you try, you'll be asked to improve iteratively. If you tie your self-worth to your thesis and rely on your advisor's validation to feel valuable, you'll never feel good enough.</p>

            <p>No matter how difficult your current situation, one thing no one can take from you is your mindset and attitude. Choose perspectives that support your mental health. As Viktor Frankl said: </p>
            
            <blockquote>
                "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances."
                <br>— Viktor Frankl
            </blockquote>
            
            <h3>2. Understand your advisor's role—they don't doubt you; they challenge you</h3>
            <p>Advisors push you to ensure you truly understand your work and can see the thesis problem from all angles. Don't take their criticism personally.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Separate your personal worth from your work</h3>
            <p>You have value as a human being independent of your academic work. Always remind yourself: "Live your life to improve, not to prove." I learned this concept from this video:</p>
            
            <div style="margin: 40px 0; padding: 30px; background-color: #111; border: 1px solid #333; border-radius: 8px; text-align: center;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">"We Oneness Talk EP.68 | ความสำเร็จvs.ความไม่สำเร็จ เรากำลังหลงลืมอะไรไป?"</p>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_uNCZb1OJE" target="_blank" style="display: inline-block; padding: 12px 30px; background-color: #ff0000; color: white; border-radius: 5px; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Watch the video that inspired this lesson</a>
            </div>

            <h3>4. Don't fear judgment—you'll be judged regardless</h3>
            <p>Accept that evaluation is inevitable and move forward anyway. Sometimes it's worth pausing to reflect on the criticism you receive—it might reveal blind spots or perspectives on improving your work that you hadn't considered before</p>
            
            <h3>5. Just take action</h3>
            <p>Small actions reveal the next step. Even when you're at your darkest point, taking action creates a spark of light.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Document your journey</h3>
            <p>Track how long you spend on problems. If it's taking too long, just ASK for help. A graduate degree friend once shared a Steve Jobs video:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Most people fail to gain valuable experiences simply "because they never ask". I never found anyone who didn't want to help when I reached out to them directly"
                <br>— Steve Jobs
            </blockquote>


            <div style="margin: 40px 0; padding: 30px; background-color: #111; border: 1px solid #333; border-radius: 8px; text-align: center;">

                 A: Ask..."

            </div>
        
            <h3>7. Believe in your own work</h3>
            <p>Even if your thesis isn't perfect, don't discredit yourself. If only one person trusts your work, it should be you—you know it better than anyone. As time passes and your baseline improves, you'll forget the small achievements that once felt impossible. Remember to credit yourself for every tiny accomplishment; these will be lifelines on days when you feel lost. Look back at the path you've walked and remember it was once difficult for you too.</p>

            <h3>8.  Know when to be open to feedback and when to protect your work</h3>
            <p>Understanding the context determines the appropriate response.</p>

            <h3>9. "Transfer learning" is the best method when things move fast</h3>
            <p>9. "Transfer learning" is the best method when things move fast
I learned tremendously from coursework projects with my CP brothers and CS friends. Don't underestimate the things you learn from friends—it is comparable to learning from instructors in this era.</p>
            
            <h3>9. View each obstacle as a checkpoint</h3>
            <p>Every barrier signals something that needs your attention.</p>
            
            <h3>10. Rejection teaches more than acceptance</h3>
            <p>It's an expensive experience that money can't buy—and it may be the most valuable investment in your future journey. I faced rejection twice, and it hurt and exhausted me at the time, but it taught me how to handle things beyond my control—something everyone faces at least once in life. I'm grateful this journey gave me this lesson at this age.</p>

        </div>

            <h3>11. Don't focus so much on the finish line that you forget to enjoy the present</h3>
            <p>Cherish your friends, teachers, the fun of group work, the laughter over "how fucking hard our lives are," the taste of coffee, the faculty environment, department snacks and lunch boxes. These create valuable memories that will bring you happiness when you look back—perhaps even more than your thesis results.</p>

            <h3>12. Be yourself, be weird</h3>
            <p>No matter how unusual you feel you are, there's a community where you'll meet people with the same energy. Trust the natural selection process.</p>

            <h3>13. Don't blame yourself for mistakes</h3>
            <p>Zoom out from the situation and consider that maybe this incident needed to happen to equip you for future challenges. There are always reasons something needs to occur.</p>
